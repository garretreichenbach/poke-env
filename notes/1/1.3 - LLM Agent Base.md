# LLMAgentBase Class Structure

## Overview

The `LLMAgentBase` class serves as a bridge between a Language Model (LLM) and the Pokémon battle simulator. It inherits from the `Player` class in poke-env and provides the necessary infrastructure to turn LLM outputs into valid battle actions.

## Key Components

### Initialization

```python
def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    self.standard_tools = STANDARD_TOOL_SCHEMA
    self.battle_history = []
```

- Inherits from `Player` class
- Sets up standard tools (functions) for the LLM to use
- Initializes battle history for tracking

### Standard Tools

The class provides two main tools for the LLM to use:

1. `choose_move`: Allows the LLM to select a move during battle
2. `choose_switch`: Allows the LLM to switch to a different Pokémon

These tools are defined in `STANDARD_TOOL_SCHEMA` and provide a consistent interface for the LLM to interact with the battle.

### Battle State Formatting

```python
def _format_battle_state(self, battle: Battle) -> str:
    # Formats current battle state into a string representation
    # Includes information about:
    # - Active Pokémon (yours and opponent's)
    # - Available moves
    # - Available switches
    # - Weather, terrain, and side conditions
```

This method converts the complex battle state into a string representation that can be sent to the LLM for decision-making.

### Move and Pokémon Handling

```python
def _find_move_by_name(self, battle: Battle, move_name: str) -> Optional[Move]:
    # Finds a move by name from available moves

def _find_pokemon_by_name(self, battle: Battle, pokemon_name: str) -> Optional[Pokemon]:
    # Finds a Pokémon by name from available switches
```

These helper methods translate between the names provided by the LLM and the actual Move/Pokémon objects in the battle.

### Core Battle Logic

```python
async def choose_move(self, battle: Battle) -> str:
    # Main method called each turn
    # 1. Format battle state
    # 2. Get LLM decision
    # 3. Process the decision into a valid battle order
    # 4. Handle errors and fallbacks
```

This is the core method that:
1. Gets the current battle state
2. Sends it to the LLM for a decision
3. Processes the LLM's response
4. Handles any errors or invalid choices
5. Returns a valid battle order

### LLM Decision Interface

```python
async def _get_llm_decision(self, battle_state: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Abstract method that must be implemented by subclasses
    # This is where the LLM API calls happen
    raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement _get_llm_decision")
```

This is the abstract method that subclasses (like your custom agent) must implement to connect to a specific LLM provider and get decisions.

## Decision Flow

1. The battle simulator calls `choose_move` when it's your agent's turn
2. Your agent formats the battle state
3. The formatted state is sent to the LLM via `_get_llm_decision`
4. The LLM returns a decision in a standardized format
5. The decision is processed into a valid battle order
6. If errors occur, fallback strategies are used
7. The final order is sent back to the battle simulator

## Implementation Requirements

To create your own agent using this base class, you need to:

1. Inherit from `LLMAgentBase`
2. Implement `_get_llm_decision` to connect to your chosen LLM
3. Design an effective system prompt for the LLM
4. Handle API errors and edge cases appropriately
5. Ensure your LLM returns decisions in the expected format

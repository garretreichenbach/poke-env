# Poke-Env Documentation Notes

## Overview

Poke-env is a Python interface designed to create battling Pokémon agents. It provides an easy-to-use framework for developing rule-based or reinforcement learning bots to battle on [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/).

**Documentation:** [Read the Docs](https://poke-env.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Key Components

### Player Classes

- **Player**: The base class for all agents, handling battle mechanics and server communication
- **RandomPlayer**: A simple agent that makes decisions randomly
- **MaxBasePowerPlayer**: An agent that selects moves with the highest base power
- **SimpleHeuristicsPlayer**: A more advanced agent using basic strategies

### Battle Environment

- **Battle**: Represents a single battle state, including all Pokémon, moves, and battle conditions
- **AbstractBattle**: Base class for battles
- **DoubleBattle**: Extension for double battle formats

### Pokémon and Moves

- **Pokemon**: Class representing a Pokémon, with attributes like types, abilities, and stats
- **Move**: Class representing a Pokémon move, with attributes like power, accuracy, and effects
- **PokemonType**: Enumeration of Pokémon types with damage calculation utilities

### Environment Components

- **Weather**: Represents in-battle weather conditions (rain, sun, etc.)
- **Field**: Represents field conditions (terrains, gravity, etc.)
- **Status**: Represents status conditions (burn, paralysis, etc.)
- **Effect**: Represents in-battle effects (confusion, leech seed, etc.)
- **SideCondition**: Represents team-specific conditions (spikes, stealth rock, etc.)

### Teambuilding

- **Teambuilder**: Abstract class for teambuilding
- **ConstantTeambuilder**: Simple teambuilder that always returns the same team
- **TeambuilderPokemon**: Representation of a Pokémon for teambuilding

### Server Connection

- **PSClient**: Handles communication with Pokémon Showdown servers
- **AccountConfiguration**: Handles authentication
- **ServerConfiguration**: Configures server connections

### Gymnasium Integration

- **PokeEnv**: Base class implementing Gymnasium API for reinforcement learning
- **SinglesEnv**: Environment for single battles compatible with Gymnasium
- **SingleAgentWrapper**: Wrapper for single-agent training

## Key Functionality

1. **Battle Mechanics**: Complete implementation of Pokémon battle mechanics
2. **Server Communication**: Handles all aspects of connecting to and battling on Pokémon Showdown
3. **Agent Development**: Framework for developing custom battle agents
4. **Reinforcement Learning Integration**: Compatible with Gymnasium for training reinforcement learning agents
5. **Team Management**: Utilities for creating and managing teams

## Usage Patterns

- Creating agents by inheriting from the `Player` class
- Implementing the `choose_move` method to define agent behavior
- Using `battle_against` to pit agents against each other
- Using `cross_evaluate` to compare multiple agents
- Using `ladder` to have agents play on the Pokémon Showdown ladder

## Examples Available

- Basic random agent implementation
- Max damage player implementation
- Creating custom teambuilders
- Reinforcement learning with Gymnasium wrapper
- Connecting to Showdown and challenging human players

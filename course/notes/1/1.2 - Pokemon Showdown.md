# Pokémon Showdown and Its Battle Interface

## Overview

Pokémon Showdown is an open-source battle simulator for Pokémon games. It allows players to battle each other online without needing to own the actual Pokémon games. In the context of the poke-env library, Showdown serves as the platform where your AI agent will battle.

## Key Components

### Showdown Server

- **Role**: Hosts battles, handles game mechanics, and manages communication
- **Protocol**: Uses WebSocket for real-time communication
- **Authorization**: Uses a simple username/password system
- **Battle Rooms**: Each battle gets its own room with a unique identifier

### Battle Formats

- **Singles**: Traditional 1v1 Pokémon battles
- **Doubles**: 2v2 battles where each player controls two Pokémon at once
- **Random Battles**: Teams are randomly generated
- **Custom Formats**: Various rulesets with specific bans and restrictions

### Battle Interface

#### Battle Initialization

- Team Preview: Optional phase where players see each other's teams before choosing lead Pokémon
- Turn Order: Determined by Pokémon speed stats and move priority

#### Available Actions

1. **Moves**:
   - Each Pokémon can have up to 4 moves
   - Special moves like Z-Moves, Dynamax moves, and Terastallize are available in certain formats
   - Target selection is required in Doubles battles

2. **Switching**:
   - Replace active Pokémon with another from your team
   - May be forced when a Pokémon faints
   - May be prevented by trapping moves or abilities

3. **Other Actions**:
   - Mega Evolution: Transform eligible Pokémon into their Mega form
   - Z-Moves: Use powerful one-time moves (Gen 7)
   - Dynamax: Power up a Pokémon for three turns (Gen 8)
   - Terastallize: Change a Pokémon's type (Gen 9)

#### Battle State

The battle state includes numerous elements:
- Active Pokémon (yours and opponent's)
- HP and status conditions
- Weather and field effects
- Side conditions (Stealth Rock, Spikes, etc.)
- Boosts and debuffs
- Available moves and switches
- Turn count

## Communication with Showdown

### Message Protocol

Showdown uses a custom text-based protocol for communication. Messages are sent as pipe-separated strings:

```
|move|p1a: Pikachu|Thunderbolt|p2a: Gyarados
```

The message above indicates that Player 1's Pikachu used Thunderbolt on Player 2's Gyarados.

### Key Message Types

- **Battle Start**: `|init|battle`
- **Player Info**: `|player|p1|username|avatar`
- **Team Preview**: `|teampreview`
- **Turn Start**: `|turn|1`
- **Move Use**: `|move|pokemon|move|target`
- **Damage**: `|damage|pokemon|hp/maxhp|[from] source`
- **Healing**: `|heal|pokemon|hp/maxhp|[from] source`
- **Status**: `|-status|pokemon|status`
- **Weather**: `|-weather|condition`
- **Victory**: `|win|username`

### Making Decisions

To make a decision, your agent needs to send a properly formatted message:

- **Move**: `/choose move move_name`
- **Switch**: `/choose switch pokemon_position`
- **Mega Evolve**: `/choose move move_name mega`
- **Z-Move**: `/choose move move_name zmove`
- **Dynamax**: `/choose move move_name dynamax`
- **Terastallize**: `/choose move move_name terastallize`

In Doubles battles, target selection is often required:
- `/choose move move_name target_position`

## Poke-Env Abstractions

The poke-env library handles most of the protocol details for you:

- **PSClient**: Manages WebSocket connection and authentication
- **Player.create_order()**: Creates properly formatted decision messages
- **Battle.parse_message()**: Parses incoming messages into a battle state
- **AbstractBattle**: Maintains the current battle state for decision-making

## Hosting a Local Server

For development purposes, you can host a local Pokémon Showdown server:

1. Clone the Pokémon Showdown repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Copy config file: `cp config/config-example.js config/config.js`
4. Start server with `node pokemon-showdown start --no-security`

The `--no-security` flag disables rate limiting and authentication requirements, which is useful for development and testing.

## Common Challenges

1. **Timing**: Showdown expects decisions within a time limit
2. **Valid Moves**: Only certain moves are valid in each situation
3. **Protocol Understanding**: Properly interpreting the battle state
4. **Error Handling**: Recovering from invalid decisions
5. **Battle Logic**: Understanding the complex game mechanics
